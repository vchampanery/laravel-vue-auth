# Laravel Vue.js Authentication App

## Overview
This is a simple web application built with Laravel and Vue.js that provides basic authentication features including login and registration.

## Code Structure
- **app/Http/Controllers/Auth**: Contains controllers for handling authentication logic.
- **resources/js/components**: Contains Vue components for login and registration.
- **routes/web.php**: Defines routes for the application.

## Decisions Made
- Used Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding for ease of implementation.
- Utilized Vue.js for a reactive front-end experience.
- Implemented form validation on both the client and server sides to ensure data integrity.
